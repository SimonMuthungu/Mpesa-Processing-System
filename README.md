# Mpesa-Processing-System
A money processing system made using python that works like the Mpesa system with all core functionalities. It uses smtp to send user summary via email and stores user information using json files. I have shared some user files created by the system.
The pdf file is also generated by the system on request by the user. It is sent to them via email.
